## About

*System for HEBrew Text: ANnotations for Queries and Markup*

[SHEBANQ](http://shebanq.ancient-data.org)
is a website with a search engine for the Hebrew Bible, powered by the
[BHSA](https://github.com/ETCBC/bhsa)
linguistic database, also known as ETCBC or WIVU.

The ETCBC is lead by
[prof. dr. Willem Th. van Peursen](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/willem-van-peursen).

## History

SHEBANQ was first deployed in 2014, by DANS, for the ETCBC, in the context of CLARIN.

The evolution of SHEBANQ till now can be seen in

which reflects the history of SHEBANQ since October 2017.
It still contains the documentation and lots of useful information.

Medio summer 2023 SHEBANQ migrated to KNAW/HuC in the context of CLARIAH,
which acts as the successor of CLARIN.
